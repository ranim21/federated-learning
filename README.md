# Project Title: Federated Learning Client Selection

## Overview

This project focuses on implementing Federated Learning (FL) with a customized client selection approach. The Federated Learning setup includes a Flower server and multiple Flower clients that participate in the learning process.

## Steps to Launch a Local Server using Flower:

### 1. Clone the Repository and Navigate to the Custom Metrics Example:

```bash
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/adap/flower.git && mv flower/examples/custom-metrics . && rm -rf flower && cd custom-metrics
```

### 2. Create and Activate a Virtual Environment:

```bash
python -m venv fl
fl\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

### 3. Install Requirements:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Start the Flower Server:

```bash
python server.py
```

### 5. Launch Flower Clients:

Open two additional terminals and run the following command in each:

```bash
python client.py
```

## GitHub Repository Setup:

### 1. Initialize a Git Repository:

```bash
git init
```

### 2. Add the Remote Repository URL:

```bash
git remote add origin <repo_url>
```

### 3. Stage Changes and Commit:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit with Flower setup"
```

### 4. Push to the Main Branch:

```bash
git push origin main
```

## Integration of Customized Client Selection Algorithms:

The next steps involve integrating customized client selection algorithms into the Federated Learning setup. The following algorithms are planned to be integrated:

1. **FedCs (Federated Client Selection):**
   - Detailed steps for integrating the FedCs algorithm will be added here.

2. **RBCS-F (Reputation Based Client Selection with Fairness):**
   - Detailed steps for integrating the RBCS-F algorithm will be added here.

Keep in mind to follow the appropriate documentation for each client selection algorithm and ensure compatibility with the Flower FL framework.
